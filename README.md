# Tic Tac Toe - Project 0
 This is a Tic Tac Toe game that allows two users to play on the same device which runs on a web browser.

 ---

## Motivation
This is project 0 for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course (SEI57). Consolidating learnings on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

---

## Known Issues
* The AI button doesn't do anything yet.

---

## Future Plan
I would like to get the AI component working using minimax algorithm, with the ability to turn AI on and off at any time during the game to maximise win for the AI.

## Resources Used
* math.js
* animate.css

## Special Thanks and Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Loden Genden and Joel Turnbull, our TA and instructor for SEI57 in Sydney, Australia, for guiding me throughout the project.
