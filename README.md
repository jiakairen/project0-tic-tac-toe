# Tic Tac Toe - Project 0

## Known Issues
* The AI algorithm currently selects a random empty box on the board.
* The AI places its first symbol before symbols from the last round clear when restarting a round. Resulting in two symbols are squeezed into one box short a short period of time.
* The page does not rescale properly when window width is decreased.

---

## Future Plan
I would like to get the AI component working using minimax algorithm, with the ability to turn AI on and off at any time during the game to maximise win for the AI.

## Resources Used
* math.js
* animate.css

## Special Thanks
